# tax-bracket-calculator

The purpose of this project is to experiment with making a website along with making something useful. 

I think income tax brackets often fall into some common misconceptions, hopefully this project will be able to provide
a better understand of how they work.

This is not intended to be used to calculate your income tax, simply to play around with the brackets to see how the
changes would affect what tax gets paid.
